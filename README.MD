# Serverless Template - AWS Python3
This is a template repo to create an AWS Python3 based serverless project witha custom file tructure that I prefer.  It also includes some base dependencies that I often make use of to save keystrokes.

After creating your project from this template recommend installing and updating dependencies to ensure you have the latest version of all shared libraries.

- poetry update
- npm update
